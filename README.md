# SurfReportBot

### Bringing the Surf Report to a Terminal Near You


#### Intro
I love the beach. There's really nothing like the feeling of dropping in,
stalling a bit, getting tubed, then flying out of the barrel to the cheers of
your mates from the lineup.

Unfortunately, I can't always be out there to surf every great swell, but I
still like keeping up with swell patterns to be able to see what I'm missing and
maybe get a session in later that day.

This project uses the MagicSeaweed API to get the current surf report and report
it to me to assist with those mind surf sessions that happen when I'm sitting at
my desk.

### Usage
To get started, just run this script from your .bashrc/.zshrc/whatever shell you
use. That's it. Really, that's it.

### Credits
Shoutout to MagicSeaweed for providing this sick API for using. You guys are the
best!
